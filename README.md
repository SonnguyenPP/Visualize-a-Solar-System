Python Project Details
In this Python Project, we are going to visualize a Solar System. We will see how the planets revolve around the sun. Also, we will be using different colors to show different planets and assign them with speed and paths to make our project look real. We are going to use the Math Module and Turtle Module to create objects in the solar system and depict their movement.
